Building a Legal Case Scraper and AI Assistant for Kenya Law Website
Scraping Kenya Law Cases
To gather all case law from the Kenya Law website, first understand the site structure. The Case Search section lists cases by court (Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, High Court, etc.)
kenyalaw.org
. Each court page shows multiple result pages (“Next”/“Last” links) and each case entry has a “Read More” detail page (as shown for a Supreme Court case
kenyalaw.org
kenyalaw.org
). Use Python HTTP libraries to navigate and parse this structure. For example, send GET requests (using requests) to each court’s search page URL, parse the HTML with BeautifulSoup to extract case links and pagination controls
geeksforgeeks.org
geeksforgeeks.org
. Loop through all result pages for each court. On each case’s detail page, scrape metadata (case number, parties, judges, date, citation) and the text of the judgment. If the site provides an “Original Source Document” (often a PDF), download it via Python (requests or a file-download method). Store the raw PDF or convert it to text using a PDF library (e.g. PyMuPDF or pdfplumber) so you have machine-readable case text. Use Selenium if any content is dynamically loaded by JavaScript (though Kenya Law pages appear static)

. Always set a polite rate-limit and include a proper User-Agent. Python’s rich scraping ecosystem is ideal here. The requests library can fetch pages, and BeautifulSoup (bs4) can parse HTML

. If needed, selenium automates a browser to render dynamic content

. For large or repetitive scraping jobs, frameworks like Scrapy could also be used. To extract PDF text, tools like PyMuPDF or Apache Tika are useful. Ensure you handle images or scanned documents: you may need OCR if some cases are stored as images. Collect all content (text, metadata, PDFs, images) and prepare it for storage.
Data Storage Design
Store scraped data in a structured database plus file storage. For example, use a relational database (PostgreSQL) or document store (MongoDB) to hold case metadata (ID, court, date, parties, judges, citation) and searchable text. Long text (case body) can go in text fields or a separate “case_content” table. Store large files (PDFs, images) outside the DB – e.g. on disk or in cloud object storage – with the database holding file paths or URLs. This avoids overloading the DB with binary BLOBs. Many projects use S3 (or similar) for PDFs and a reference column in SQL. If you prefer all-in-DB, note that some databases support BLOB columns, but best practice often uses filesystem or object storage for documents. You should also index the text for search: consider full-text indexes or external search engines if needed. Design the schema to allow easy querying. For example, a “Cases” table keyed by case number or a unique ID, with columns for court, year, summary, and a foreign key to “Documents” table where PDF file info is stored. Also include any attachments or images in a related table or storage. This structured storage lets your app quickly retrieve case info. (No specific citation is needed here, as this is standard data engineering practice.)
Update Scheduling and Automation
To keep data current, schedule the scraper to run weekly. You can use system cron jobs (on Linux) or task schedulers on Windows to run your Python script at fixed times. As sources note, system cron is a “time-based job scheduler” ideal for repeated tasks
firecrawl.dev
. Alternatively, Python’s schedule library or a framework like Airflow/Celery can orchestrate periodic jobs
geeksforgeeks.org
firecrawl.dev
. For example, a weekly cron entry could invoke the scraper script. On the first run each cycle, check for new cases (e.g. by comparing dates or case numbers) and only scrape what’s new. Also provide an on-demand trigger (e.g. an HTTP endpoint) so a user can launch a fresh scrape if needed. Many cloud-based solutions (GitHub Actions, PythonAnywhere, Heroku scheduler, AWS Lambda, etc.) offer free tiers for scheduling jobs
firecrawl.dev
firecrawl.dev
. For simplicity, you could also use GitHub Actions to run the scraper on a schedule (GitHub Actions can run workflows hourly/daily/weekly)
firecrawl.dev
. Whichever method, handle failures and changes: maintain logs and alerts so you know if the scraper breaks (e.g. due to HTML changes). Following best practices, respect the site’s robots.txt and rate-limit your requests
firecrawl.dev
.
Legal/Ethical Considerations
While Kenya Law content is publicly accessible, be aware of legal constraints. Automated scraping of public legal texts is generally allowed, but check the Data Protection Act (2019) (for any personal data) and the Copyright Act (2001) (for original text)
mwakili.com
mwakili.com
. The site’s Terms of Service may also prohibit automated access. In practice, many jurisdictions allow scraping of publicly-available non-sensitive data, but you should minimize server load (e.g. obey any rate limits or crawl-delay) and avoid scraping copyrighted commentary. Ensure any personal data in case documents is handled per law. In Kenya, unauthorized access or breach of cybersecurity laws is not an issue if you scrape only public web content. Still, always include attribution or links to the source when redistributing content. (For example, you might credit Kenya Law as source for each case.)
AI Integration (Summarization & Q&A)
With the case texts collected, integrate AI to assist lawyers. Two main capabilities are useful:
Case Summarization: Use a large language model to produce concise summaries of each case. Modern LLMs (like OpenAI’s GPT-4) excel at this. For instance, the Debevoise law blog notes GPT-4 is well-suited for summarizing case law and contracts
debevoisedatablog.com
. You can feed each case’s full text (or key excerpts) into an LLM prompt asking for a summary of facts, issues, and holding. If cases are large, use a model with a big context window (GPT-4.1 supports up to ~1,500 pages via API
debevoisedatablog.com
). Alternatively, use the Hugging Face Transformers summarization pipeline or a legal-domain fine-tuned model to generate extracts. Store the generated summary with each case for quick reference.
Q&A / Research Assistant: Implement a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. Embed each case’s text into a vector database (using e.g. sentence transformers). At query time, convert the lawyer’s question into an embedding and use a vector DB (FAISS, Pinecone, Milvus, or Chroma) to retrieve the most relevant case passages
milvus.io
. Then combine those passages with the question in an LLM prompt to generate an answer. The Milvus guide explains this: a RAG system indexes legal documents as vectors and uses them to fetch context for accurate answers
milvus.io
. In practice, your workflow could be: (1) tokenize case texts into chunks, (2) compute embeddings, (3) store in vector DB, (4) on query, retrieve top-k relevant passages, (5) pass them plus the query to the model (ChatGPT, GPT-4, etc.) to answer. Tools like LangChain facilitate building such pipelines. According to Milvus, tools like FAISS or Pinecone are commonly used for RAG systems in law
milvus.io
. This approach gives precise, citation-backed answers.
Both summarization and Q&A benefit from fine-tuning or prompting for legal style. Be cautious of hallucinations: always have a human review AI outputs. For added accuracy, consider a two-step approach (retrieve excerpts, then summarize). Also, you can use the AI to extract metadata (e.g. issue tags) or suggest related cases. In short, leverage LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) or open-source LMs (like LLaMA/llama_index) combined with your indexed data.
App Architecture (Web & Mobile)
Your application can be a web backend (e.g. Django/Flask/FastAPI) exposing REST or GraphQL APIs. It connects to your database of cases and a vector-store for retrieval. For the UI, either build a responsive web app (React/Angular) that also works on mobile browsers, or create a separate mobile client (React Native or Flutter) calling the same APIs. The backend would handle user queries, fetch case data (and AI-generated answers) from DB, and return JSON to the frontend. When a lawyer asks a question, the backend invokes the RAG pipeline and returns the answer text (with references). For summaries, the backend might either pre-generate them or produce on-the-fly with cached results. Deploy the backend on a cloud server (AWS/GCP/Azure) or platforms like Heroku; ensure the scraper jobs can run in the same environment (e.g. a daily cron on the server or a separate worker process). Use HTTPS and authentication so only authorized lawyers can access the data. Optionally, build the app as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for mobile compatibility, or use React Native for both iOS/Android.
